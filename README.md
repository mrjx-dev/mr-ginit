# Mr-Ginit

ginit â€“ A CLI tool to quickly initialize a GitHub-ready project. (Inspired by github-cli)

**`mr-ginit`** is focused on **speed, simplicity, and ease of use**:

---

### âœ… **One-Command Setup (Zero Config, No Overthinking)**

- Make `ginit` work with just one simple command like:

  ```bash
  ginit project-name
  ```

  This would:

  - Create a project directory.
  - Initialize a Git repository.
  - Create a `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `SECURITY.md` with opinionated defaults.

---

### ðŸš€ **Interactive Mode (Minimal Prompts)**

- Allow users to type `ginit` without arguments to launch an **interactive setup**:

  ```bash
  ginit
  ```

  Prompts could be as simple as:

  - Project name?
  - License type?
  - Add a `.gitignore` for [Python, Go, etc.]?

---

### ðŸ”‘ **Small Binary (Fast Install)**

- Lightweight binary for quick download and execution.
